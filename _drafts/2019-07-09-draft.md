Drafts will be hidden by default, and are particularly useful when you're writing content that may not be finished, and you'd like to to store it somewhere on the site in the interim.
<br /><br />
If you'd like to make your draft content viewable on the site ( while it's still in the `_drafts` folder ), you can do so by running the below command:
```bash
$ jekyll serve --draft
```
