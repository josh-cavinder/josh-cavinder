You can use the below variables to pull from numerous sources within the site:
<br /><br />
`layout.title` => will pull **front matter** variables from layout files.<br />
`page.title` => will pull **front matter** variables from your actual pages.<br />
`site.title` => will pull variables from the `_config.yml` file.
<br /><br />
These can be referenced from pretty much _anywhere_.
<br /><br />
