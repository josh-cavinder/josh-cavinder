While at Midnet, I'd also went through a period where my top priority was to focus on the creation of landing pages. Between May 2016 and March 2017, we were hired to do a number of rapid turnaround landing pages for one of our clients who is involved in the political market. The majority of these needed to be knocked out within a 24 - 48 hour window, so we essentially created an a la carte system where their designers could choose from the different sections that we'd created ( ex. hero image, videos, multi-column, etc. ) to base their designs off of. This really helped so that we didn't need to start from ground zero every single time.

We ended up creating 65 of these in total, but most ( if not all ) of them have been taken down since their use has been served. I've pulled several of them from GitLab if you'd like to look through those as well here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H46Rg5Z007T5xdRa34jGEJB3I17wdIW3.
